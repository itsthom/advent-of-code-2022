# Advent of Code 2020!

Let's try this again! https://adventofcode.com

## How Do?

Install dependencies using:
```
yarn install
```

Run all the stuff in index with `yarn start`. Tests use jest, linter is ESLint with [Javascript Standard](https://standardjs.com/index.html) rules.

`yarn test` will lint everything and run all the tests. To use either CLI individually for more focus you can `yarn eslint [args]` or `yarn jest [args]`.
